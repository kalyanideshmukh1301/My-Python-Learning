1. break statement

Used to exit a loop immediately when a condition is met.
The loop is terminated and control goes to the next statement after the loop.


•Example:

for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        break  # stop the loop when i = 5
    print(i)

Output:

1
2
3
4

2. continue statement

Used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.
The loop is not terminated, only that one iteration is skipped.


Example:

for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue  # skip when i = 3
    print(i)

 Output:

1
2
4
5

3. pass statement

It is just a placeholder to avoid syntax errors.
Often used when you haven’t written the code yet but want to keep the structure.


•Example:

for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        pass  # does nothing
    print(i)

Output:

1
2
3
4
5
