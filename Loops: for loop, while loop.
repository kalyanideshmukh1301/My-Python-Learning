•Loops in Python•

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a condition is met.
There are mainly two types:

1. for loop
2. while loop

1. for loop

Used when you know how many times you want to repeat.
Iterates over a sequence (like list, string, range).


Syntax:

for variable in sequence:
    # code block

Example 1: Print numbers 1 to 5

for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

Output:

1
2
3
4
5

2. while loop

Used when you don’t know in advance how many times to repeat.
Runs as long as the condition is True.


Syntax:

while condition:
    # code block

Example 1: Print numbers 1 to 5

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

Output:

1
2
3
4
5


•Difference between for and while•

•for loop → use when you know the number of repetitions.

•while loop → use when you repeat until a condition changes.
