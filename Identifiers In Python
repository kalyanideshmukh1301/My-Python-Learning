#Identifiers in Python

Identifiers are the names used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules, or other objects in Python.
They are like labels that help us refer to values or objects stored in memory.

Rules for Writing Identifiers

1. Allowed characters:

•Alphabets (a–z, A–Z)

•Digits (0–9)

•Underscore (_)



2. Cannot start with a digit

•name1 → valid  
•1name → invalid



3. Case-sensitive

•Name, name, and NAME are all different identifiers.



4. No special characters

•student@name, total% are invalid



5. No reserved keywords

•Keywords like if, while, class, etc. cannot be used as identifiers.



6. Can be of any length

•But should be meaningful and readable.

Example1: 
           # Identifiers: student_name, age, totalMarks
              student_name = "Kalyani"
              age = 20
              totalMarks = 450

              print("Name:", student_name)
              print("Age:", age)
              print("Marks:", totalMarks)

Output: Name: Kalyani
        Age:20
        Marks:450

Example2: # Wrong identifiers
1student = "ABC"     # starts with a digit
class = "Math"       # 'class' is a keyword
total-marks = 300    # special character '-'
