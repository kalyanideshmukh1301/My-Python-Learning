1] INTRODUCTION TO PRTHON
Python is a high level interpreted language. It is widely used because of simplicity and readability.
Python emphasizes code readability with straight forward syntax. It is object oriented programming, it supports classes and objects.
Python used in web development, AI , Machine learning , data science , etc.

EXAMPLE: print("Hello World!") #Hello World

         # Simple Addition Program
         a = 10
         b = 30
         sum = a + b
         print("sum:",a + b)  # 10 + 30 = 40
