Comments are used to explain the code.
They make the program easier to understand.
Python ignores comments during execution, so they don’t affect the output.

• Types of Comments

1. Single-line Comment
Starts with # symbol.
Everything after # on that line is ignored.

Example:
          # This is a single-line comment
          x = 10  # storing value in x
          print(x)

2. Multi-line Comment
Python doesn’t have a special syntax for multi-line comments, but you can do it in two ways:

(a) Use # on multiple lines

# Line 1 of comment
# Line 2 of comment
# Line 3 of comment

(b) Use triple quotes (''' ... ''' or """ ... """)

They are mostly for docstrings, but can also act like multi-line comments.

This is a multi-line comment
that spans across several lines
Python will ignore it

print("Hello World")

• Why Use Comments?

1. To explain the purpose of code.

2. To make code easier to read for yourself and others.

3. To help with debugging and maintenance.

4. For documentation in larger projects.


CODE:  # Program: Student Grading Example

       # Store marks of a student
       marks = 95

       # Check grade based on marks
       if marks >= 90:
       grade = "A+"
       elif marks >= 75:
       grade = "A"
       elif marks >= 50:
       grade = "B"
       else:
       grade = "Fail"
       print("Marks:", marks)
       print("Grade:", grade)

Output: Marks: 95
        Grade: A+
