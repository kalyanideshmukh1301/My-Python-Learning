if, else, elif in Python

These are conditional statements.
They allow a program to make decisions based on conditions (True/False).

1. if Statement.

•Used to test a condition.
•If the condition is True, the block of code runs.


Syntax:

if condition:
    # code to run if condition is True

Example:

age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")

Output: You are eligible to vote.

2. if...else Statement

•Provides an alternative if the condition is False.


Syntax:

if condition:
    # code if condition is True
else:
    # code if condition is False

Example:

age = 16
if age >= 19:
    print("You can vote.")
else:
    print("You are too young to vote.")

Output: You are too young to vote.

3. if...elif...else Statement

•Used when you have multiple conditions to check.
•elif means else if.
•Only one block will run (the first True condition).


Syntax:

if condition1:
    # code if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # code if condition2 is True
elif condition3:
    # code if condition3 is True
else:
    # code if none of the above are True

Example:

marks = 72

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
elif marks >= 50:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: Fail")

Output: Grade: C
